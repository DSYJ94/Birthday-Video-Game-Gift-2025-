# Birthday-Video-Game-Gift-2025-
Repo for a surprise video game gift that I vibecoded for my girlfriend.

**Background:**
TLDR: I was scrambling for ideas to surprise her and thought - why not vibe-code a video game that tailors to major aspects of her life: 1.) Law and 2.) Knitting

**Approach:**
1. Fired up Claude Code and resourced model usage between Opus 4 and Sonnet 4. Opus for planning and heavy execution, Sonnet for general execution and tracking progress.
2. Initialised a CLAUDE.md with instructions to plan tech stack, features, key graphical design, game quiz design, embedded video player, general player control and movement, background music amongst others.
3. CLAUDE.md file management is key, with explicit instructions to refactor the .MD every session so as to reduce filesize and overencumbering the initial context window for Claude.
4. Checkpoint saving approach with Claude noting key milestones within the CLAUDE.md file. Compacting/clearing session context windows just after major implementations to complement checkpoints.
5. Use online documentation (packages, tools, engines, etc.) and screenshots to assist Claude with more context. Pair with Github CLI to push Git commands within Termina;
6. Have loads of fun!
